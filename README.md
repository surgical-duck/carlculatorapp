## README
This simple calculator app is a hobby project of mine to learn app programming in Python using Kivy Language. Can you find all easter eggs without checking the source code?

## Build 
Build Android App APK from project source code with Buildozer. Install Buildozer `https://buildozer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html`. Create a *buildozer.spec* file in the project folder using `buildozer init` in the terminal. Compile using the command: `buildozer -v android debug`. This will take some time during the first run. At the end, you should have an APK file in the *bin/* directory.
